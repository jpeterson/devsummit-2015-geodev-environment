## Rocking and Tooling your GeoDev Environment

Time to build your hip new mapping web app. What does your development environment look like? You may have used Notepad in the past, but it’s time to upgrade to technologies like Bower, Grunt, and smarter text editors like Sublime Text and PyScripter. We'll show you some of these tools – and more that you might not already know about - so you can complete that app and become the next Zuck!

This presentation was prepared for the 2015 Esri International Developer Summit and presented by Gavin Rehkemper and Josh Peterson.
